Soulless is our ambitious debut title, currently in the prototyping phase. We're pouring our hearts and souls into crafting a unique gaming experience that we can't wait to share with you!

# What is Soulless?

Soulless is a roguelite stealth-survival game set in a hauntingly beautiful afterlife. In this realm, the souls of the deceased are processed for rebirth as part of a mysterious new cosmic order. As a newly arrived soul, you must navigate this treacherous landscape, evading detection and unraveling the secrets of your surroundings.

## Key Features:

- **Roguelite Elements**: Each night, the security system of the afterlife relocates the interiors of all buildings relating to its operation. The layouts are randomised with procedurally generated environments.
- **Stealth Gameplay**: Use your wits and newfound ethereal abilities to avoid detection by the entities that maintain this afterlife.
- **Survival Mechanics**: Manage your soul's energy and collect ethereal resources to persist in this strange new existence.
- **The Enigmatic Lantern**: At the heart of your journey is a mysterious lantern that seems to hold the key to understanding this realm.
- **Atmospheric World**: Explore a visually stunning afterlife, filled with surreal landscapes and otherworldly inhabitants.

We're working tirelessly to bring this vision to life, and we look forward to revealing more about Soulless as development progresses!
