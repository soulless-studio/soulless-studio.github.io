# Soulless

Soulless is our debut title, currently in development. A game to die for. What does that even mean?

# What is Soulless?

Soulless is set in the afterlife, where the souls of the deceased are processed for rebirth as a part of a new order. The player's goal is to survive and unlock the secrets of a mysterious lantern that may just hold the key to all the answers.
