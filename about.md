## Why "Soulless"?

Our name is a playful nod to the paradox of creativity. While some may think games are "just pixels and code," we believe in infusing every aspect of our work with heart, soul, and meaning. The name serves as a reminder to pour everything into our creations—even if the name itself might suggest otherwise.
